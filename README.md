# Convolution Nueral Network For Classification Of Charts   
## Task 1 & 2 : Image Sorting & Result of Trained Models    
### Image sorting for       
        
All charts transfered to Train/(spesific folder) as their labels and randomly 20% images transfered into validation folder. Also, images separated in test/(particular) folder, checkout mentioned structure.        
This will make labling process much easier with the help of ImageDataGenerator function.
